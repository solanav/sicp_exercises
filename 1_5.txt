The trick used is based on (define (p) (p)). This procedure
gets stuck if the interpreter uses normal-order evaluation.
This is because in normal-order, the interpreter will try to
subsitute the y parameter with a (p) that acts as an infinite
loop. On the other hand, the applicative-order will evaluate
the first expression, find that the result is zero and stop.
